# CodeAlpha Tasks 🚀

A collection of networking and security‑related projects under the “CodeAlpha” initiative.  
This repository currently holds tools and projects for network sniffing and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) using Suricata.

## 🔎 Overview  

- Contains small network‑security projects and experiments.  
- Helps you explore networking, packet sniffing, and IDS setup in Python / shell scripts.  
- Useful for students, security learners, or anyone interested in network traffic analysis or building simple IDS-based tools.  

## 📁 Projects  

| Project folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `CodeAlpha_Basic_Network_Sniffer` | A simple network sniffer (packet capture) — for learning about raw network traffic and basic packet inspection. |  
| `CodeAlpha-Suricata-IDS` | A sample setup or scripts integrating Suricata as an IDS — to detect suspicious network activity and demonstrate IDS configuration / usage. |  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Projects are mostly educational/demo — they are not production‑ready. Use them for learning, experimentation, or as a starting point for further development.

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecstaticumed/codealpha_tasks.git
cd codealpha_tasks
Then navigate to the project you want to run. For example:
cd CodeAlpha_Basic_Network_Sniffer
# Follow the instructions inside that folder — e.g. run the Python or shell script.
If you wish to use the Suricata‑based IDS:
cd CodeAlpha-Suricata-IDS
# Follow instructions inside (install Suricata, configure, run rules, etc.)
```
Rerequisites
```
Python 3.x (if the sniffer uses Python)
Required Python modules or dependencies (check inside project)
For IDS project: Suricata installed on your machine / VM, plus any required config or OS permissions.
A system where you have permissions to capture network traffic (e.g., root/admin privileges).
```
🎯 Why This Project

Gives hands‑on practice with network traffic analysis and security tools — useful if you’re studying cybersecurity or networking.
Offers a small, focused playground to learn packet sniffing, IDS concepts, and how network security tools like Suricata work.
Helps you build a portfolio — especially relevant given your background in cybersecurity and desire to showcase projects.
